        "Question": "A body is found at the bottom of a multistory building. Seeing the position of the body it is evident that the person jumped from one of the windows. A homicide detective is called to look after the case. He goes to the first floor and walks in the room facing the direction in which the body was found. He opens the window in that direction and flips a coin towards the floor. Then he goes to the second floor and repeats the process. He keeps on doing it till the last floor. Then, when he climbs down, he tells the team that it is a murder not suicide. How did he come to know that it was a murder?",
        "Answer": "At each floor, he did the same task of opening the window and flipping the coin. If it was a suicide, then at least the window at any of the floors must have been left open by the person who jumped off. The situation only suggests that someone pushed him off and then closed the window again."

{"Question":"A man lives on the twelfth floor of an apartment building. Every morning he takes the elevator down to the lobby and leaves the building. In the evening, he gets into the elevator, and, if there is someone else in the elevator -- or if it was raining that day -- he goes back to his floor directly. However, if there is nobody else in the elevator and it hasn't rained, he goes to the tenth floor and walks up two flights of stairs to his room.","Answer":"The man is a midget. He can't reach the upper elevator buttons, but he can ask people to push them for him. He can also push them with his umbrella. I've usually heard this stated with more details: \"Every morning he wakes up, gets dressed, eats, goes to the elevator...\" In the other direction, for a shorter problem statement, leave out the \"someone else in the elevator\" and \"if it was raining\" parts, and just say on his return to the building he always goes to the tenth floor. Ron Carter suggests a nice red herring: the man lives on the 13th floor of the building."},
{"Question":"A man sitting on a park bench reads a newspaper article headlined \"Death at Sea\" and knows a murder has been committed.","Answer":"The man is a travel agent. He had sold someone two tickets for an ocean voyage, one round-trip and one one-way. The last name of the man who bought the tickets is the same as the last name of the woman who \"fell\" overboard and drowned on the same voyage, which is the subject of the article he's reading. This may have derived from a story done by Alfred Hitchcock, if the following Hitchcock quotation is accurate: \"If you take your wife on a sea voyage, buy her a round-trip ticket no matter what your plans may be.\""},
{"Question":"A man lets go of a bowling ball. A short while later, he is rushed to the hospital.","Answer":"A physics professor is demonstrating conservation of energy by suspending a bowling ball from a piece of rope. He pulls the ball back until it's right in front of his nose, then lets go. It is supposed to swing away from him, then back at him, stopping just in front of his nose. Unfortunately, he gave the ball a slight push, resulting in the ball crashing into his nose upon its return."},
{"Question":"Two men enter a bar. They both order identical drinks. One lives; the other dies.","Answer":"The drinks contain poisoned ice cubes; one man drinks slowly, giving them time to melt, while the other drinks quickly and thus doesn't get much of the poison. The fact that they drink at different speeds could be added to the statement, possibly along with red herrings such as saying that one of the men is big and burly and the other short and thin."},
{"Question":"A man walks into a bar and asks for a drink. The bartender pulls out a gun and points it at him. The man says, \"Thank you,\" and walks out.","Answer":"The man has hiccups; the bartender scares them away by pulling a gun."},

A black friend of the other woman, the one who goes into the bathroom, was recently killed, reportedly by the KKK.

{"Question":"A woman in France in 1959 is waiting in her room, with all the doors locked from the inside, for her husband to come home. When he arrives, the house has burned to the ground and she's dead.","Answer":"This is apparently a true story. The hot sun reflected from the woman's large mirror (which I speculate may have been imperfectly flat and therefore focused the sunlight, but I don't know for sure) and heated the lingerie she was wearing to the burning point. She was absorbed in a book at the time and didn't notice the heat until her clothing was afire. Nobody could get to her to help because her doors were locked from the inside. Please disregard the version of this answer from previous editions of this list; it's not true."},
{"Question":"A man lies dead next to a cactus. Stuck to the cactus is a slip of paper.","Answer":"The man was lost in the desert for days. He couldn't find any landmarks, so he started sticking slips of paper to cactuses he passed. After another day of walking, with almost no water left, he came across this cactus, which had a slip of paper on it already; he knew that he was walking in circles, so rather than wait to die of thirst he shot himself."},
{"Question":"Passing by a window, you see two dead men in a room, with a gun and a deck of cards.","Answer":"You're a diver, going past a window of a sunken submarine (or ship). The two men were in a sinking vessel; they had a gun but only one bullet. Neither wanted to drown, so they played cards to see who would get the bullet. The loser shot the winner (or else the winner shot himself), and then the loser drowned when the room filled up with water."},
{"Question":"There are a carrot, a pile of pebbles, and a pipe lying together in the middle of a field.","Answer":"They're the remains of a melted snowman."},
{"Question":"Two dead people sit in their cars on a street. But the two cars did not collide and there were no criminal incidents.","Answer":"Because there was a heavy fog, two people driving in opposite directions on the same road both stuck their heads out of their windows to better see the road's center line. Their heads hit each other at high speed, killing them both."},
{"Question":"A man is found shot to death in the front seat of his car; a gun lies out of his reach in the back seat. All the windows are closed and the doors are locked; there are no bullet holes anywhere in the car","Answer":"The car is a convertible; the top was down. (Or the sunroof, or something else that's neither window nor door.) The murderer shot him and then dropped the gun into the back seat of the car."},
{"Question":"A man is sitting in a room. Another person enters, carrying a closed cardboard box, and sits down nearby. Though the first man can't see, hear, or smell the box's contents, he knows what's in the box.","Answer":"The man is allergic to cats, and feels the allergy symptoms coming on, so he knows the box contains a cat. (It could be argued that he must be able to smell the cat, but I'd say that \"smell\" implies consciously noticing a smell, and is not the same as reacting to unnoticed dander.)"},
{"Question":"There is two kinds of blood on the ceiling of my bedroom.","Answer":"A mosquito bit me, and I swatted it when it later landed on my ceiling (so the blood is my own as well as the mosquito's)."},
{"Question":"A man in uniform stands on the beach of a tropical island. He takes out a cigarette, lights it, and begins smoking. He takes out a letter and begins reading it. The cigarette burns down between his fingers, but he doesn't throw it away. He cries","Answer":"He is a guard/attendant in a leper colony. The letter (to him) tells him that he has contracted the disease. The key is the cigarette burning down between his fingers -- leprosy is fairly unique in killing off sensory nerves without destroying motor ability"},
{"Question":"A woman is heating her coffee in a small microwave oven. She puts it in for exactly two minutes. She then opens the door, closes it, then heats her coffee for two more seconds.","Answer":"She opens the door and sees that the handle of her cup is facing the back of the microwave. She then sets the oven for two more seconds so that the turntable will turn 180 degrees so that she can reach the cup-handle, to avoid burning her hand."},
{"Question":"A man tries the new cologne his wife gave him for his birthday. He goes out to get some food, and is killed.","Answer":"The man is a beekeeper, and the bees attack en masse because they don't recognize his fragrance. Randy adds that this is based on something that actually happened to his grandfather, a beekeeper who was severely attacked by his bees when he used a new aftershave for the first time in 10 or 20 years."},
{"Question":"A man takes a two-week cruise to Mexico from the U.S. Shortly after he gets back, he takes a three-day cruise which doesn't stop at any other ports. He stays in his cabin all the time on both cruises. As a result, he makes $250,000.","Answer":"He's a smuggler. On the first cruise, someone brings the contraband to his cabin, and he hides it in an air conditioning duct. Returning to the U.S., he leaves without the contraband, and so passes through customs with no trouble. On the second trip, he has the same cabin on the same ship. Because it doesn't stop anywhere, he doesn't have to go through customs when he returns, so he gets the contraband off safely."},
{"Question":"She lost her job when she invited them to dinner.","Answer":"Let's say \"she\" is named Suzy, and \"they\" are named Harry and Jane. Harry is an elderly archaeologist who has found a very old skeleton, which he's dubbed \"Jane\" (a la \"Lucy\"). Suzy is a buyer for a museum; she's supposed to make some sort of purchase from Harry, so she invites him to have a business dinner with her (at a restaurant). When she calls to invite him, he keeps talking about \"Jane,\" so Suzy assumes that Jane is his wife and says to bring her along. Harry, offended, calls Suzy's boss and complains; since Suzy should've known who Jane was, she gets fired."},
{"Question":"A man tells his boss, \"Don't take your planned flight today! I had a dream last night that if you do, your plane will crash and you'll die.\" The boss fires the man.","Answer":"The man was the night watchman; he should've been on duty the previous night, not dreaming."},
{"Question":"A man finishes getting dressed, lies down and dies.","Answer":"There is a poisonous spider in the toe of his shoe. The last things he puts on are his shoes. He gets bitten, feels ill, lies down on his bed, and then dies of the poison. (It's a particularly poisonous spider, like the Australian Funnel-Web, whose bite can kill an adult human in 5 minutes, or the brown recluse, which I gather is also pretty deadly.)"},
{"Question":"Every day a man drinks his breakfast and drinks his lunch. When his boss finds out, he is immediately fired. The man moves to another job and begins doing the same thing; this time, when his boss finds out, the boss jokingly tells him that he'll be fired if he stops.","Answer":"The man is drinking diet shakes for his breakfast and lunch in order to lose weight. Unfortunately, his first job is at a weight-loss clinic, so he is fired for patronizing the competition. His second job is at a health-food store, and his boss wants him to lose weight so he looks \"healthier.\""},
{"Question":"A car without a driver moves; a man dies.","Answer":"The murderer sets the car on a slope above the hot dog stand where the victim works. He then wedges an ice block in the car to keep the brake pedal down, and puts the car in neutral, after which he flies to another city to avoid suspicion. It's a warm day; when the ice melts, the car rolls down the hill and strikes the hot dog man at his roadside stand, killing him."},
{"Question":"A man gets onto an elevator. When the elevator stops, he knows his wife is dead.","Answer":"He's leaving a hospital after visiting his wife, who's on heavy life-support. When the power goes out, he knows she can't live without the life-support systems (he assumes that if the emergency backup generator were working, the elevator wouldn't lose power; this aspect isn't entirely satisfactory, so in a variant, the scene is at home rather than in a hospital)."},
{"Question":"A man is killed on a train. He is found to have written \"elf\" on the floor in his own blood. (MB, from \"The Problem of the Locked Caboose,\"","Answer":"Attached to the train was a caboose with a safe carrying a shipment of jewels. The victim, Schmidt, was the conductor guarding the shipment; he had robbed the safe himself, and had an accomplice traveling on the train under a false name to remove the loot. The accomplice killed Schmidt to keep his share. Schmidt didn't know the accomplice's false name, so he wrote the killer's berth number, 11. For greater clarity he spelled out the number as a word -- in his native German. (In the original story he didn't want \"11\" to be misread as two parallel lines, but Germans don't write \"1\" as a straight line.) This arguably belongs in section 2 for double meaning, but the double-meaninged word here is explicitly called out, so I'm going to leave it in section 1 for now."},
{"Question":"A man ran into a fire, and lived. A man stayed where there was no fire, and died.","Answer":"The two men were working in a small room protected by a carbon dioxide gas fire extinguisher system, when a fire broke out in an adjoining room. One of the men ran through the fire and escaped with only minor burns. The other one stayed in the room until the fire extinguishers kicked in, and died of oxygen starvation. (This originally involved a halon gas extinguisher, but those don't work that way; fortunately for our purposes, Gisle Hannemyr pointed out that CO2 extinguishers do work that way. Gisle says a CO2 extinguisher on a Norwegian ship a few years ago did go off accidentally when there was no fire, killing everyone in the engine room.)"},
{"Question":"Four people are on a grass-covered island. A fire burns from one end of the island to the other, but no one gets severely burnt.","Answer":"The fire is slow moving and the four are able to \"back burn\" by starting a new fire on the other side of them. When an area is burnt off, they can safely stand on the burnt patch, as it now contains no fuel for the grass fire. This is an actual technique used in Australian bushfires (and, I think, elsewhere)."},

{"Question":"A man enters the elevator of a high rise apartment building, takes off one glove, and pushes the button for the tenth floor. The next day, the same man enters the elevator, puts on one glove, and pushes the button for the tenth floor.","Answer":"The man is blind. His first time in the elevator, he's wearing gloves; the elevator uses buttons that work by electrical conduction through the skin; they light up at the slightest touch, but not through a glove. The man thus has to remove a glove to get the button to work. But he discovers that first day that as he runs his ungloved hand over the buttons to find the tenth floor, all the buttons are activated, and the elevator stops at all the floors. So from then on, he carries a glove with him; he puts it on when he enters the elevator, finds the right button with his gloved hand, then uses his ungloved hand to press the tenth-floor button. (Note that even if the buttons are labeled in Braille, it's hard to avoid brushing against a button and sending the elevator to the wrong floor.)"},
